# DRAGIN_simplified

This is another implementation of [DRAGIN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10081). To see the original implementation, goto [DRAGIN](https://github.com/oneal2000/DRAGIN/tree/main).

You can regard this as reproduction of the original code. Many parts of the repository is almost directly copied from the original (Especially `src/data.py` and `src/evaluate_.py`, indicating that we used consisent datasets and evaluation algorithm). The main difference are in `src/generate.py` and `src/retriever.py`. 
In this part, I have tried a significantly different implementation, though both the original code and mine follow the idea of [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10081).

However, This is a simplified work, for it only considered DRAGIN with BM25 retriever on 2WikiMultihopQA dataset and Llama-2-13b-chat model. 
If you want to adapt it to various options, some modification might be needed.

Here is some test results. Other parameters can be found in `config/DRAGIN.json`.

| hallucination_threshold | 0.6 | 0.9                | 1.2  | 1.5  | 1.8  | 2.1  | 2.4  | 2.7  |

| retrieve_count | 1.431 | 1.165 | 1.019 | 0.895 | 0.745 | 0.659 | 0.500 | 0.428 |


The remaining part of `README.md` is almost copied from the [original repository](https://github.com/oneal2000/DRAGIN/tree/main).

You can also run this code following that tutorial.

# DRAGIN

**ðŸ“¢ News: this work has been accepted at the ACL 2024 main conference!**

**If you find our project interesting or helpful, we would appreciate it if you could give us a star! Your support is a tremendous encouragement to us!**



**Welcome to the official GitHub repository for our ACL 2024 Main Conference Full paper: DRAGIN** (Dynamic Retrieval Augmented Generation based on the real-time Information Needs of LLMs), a dynamic RAG framework designed to enhance the text generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by intelligently deciding when and what to retrieve during the generation process.

## Overview

DRAGIN addresses the limitations of current dynamic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) methods by introducing a novel approach for real-time decision-making on retrieval timing and content. Our framework is built upon two core components:

- **RIND (Real-time Information Needs Detection):** A mechanism that determines the optimal moment for activation of the retrieval module by assessing the LLM's uncertainty, the importance of each token, and the semantic significance within the generated content.
- **QFS (Query Formulation based on Self-attention):** An innovative method for crafting retrieval queries that leverages the LLM's self-attention mechanism, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the context.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Retrieval:** DRAGIN actively decides when and what to retrieve, based on the LLM's real-time information needs, significantly improving the relevance and accuracy of generated text.
- **Lightweight Integration:** Designed as a lightweight framework, DRAGIN can be seamlessly incorporated into any Transformer-based LLM without the need for additional training, fine-tuning, or prompt engineering.
- **Enhanced Text Generation:** By addressing the when and what of retrieval more effectively, DRAGIN elevates the quality of LLM-generated text, making it more informative, contextually relevant, and coherent.

## Install environment

```bash
conda create -n dragin python=3.9
conda activate dragin
pip install torch==2.1.1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Run DRAGIN

### Build Wikipedia index

Download the Wikipedia dump from the [DPR repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR/blob/main/dpr/data/download_data.py#L32) using the following command:

```bash
mkdir -p data/dpr
wget -O data/dpr/psgs_w100.tsv.gz https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/dpr/wikipedia_split/psgs_w100.tsv.gz
pushd data/dpr
gzip -d psgs_w100.tsv.gz
popd
```

Use Elasticsearch to index the Wikipedia dump:

```bash
cd data
wget -O elasticsearch-7.17.9.tar.gz https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-7.17.9-linux-x86_64.tar.gz  # download Elasticsearch
tar zxvf elasticsearch-7.17.9.tar.gz
rm elasticsearch-7.17.9.tar.gz 
cd elasticsearch-7.17.9
nohup bin/elasticsearch &  # run Elasticsearch in background
cd ../..
python prep_elastic.py --data_path data/dpr/psgs_w100.tsv --index_name wiki  # build index
```

Here is the config file for using our approach to generate answers to the top 1000 questions of 2WikiMultihopQA using the model Llama-2-13b-chat.

```json
{
    "model_name_or_path": "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat",
    "method": "attn_entropy",
    "dataset": "2wikimultihopqa",
    "data_path": "../data/2wikimultihopqa",
    "generate_max_length": 64,
    "query_formulation": "real_words",
    "retrieve_keep_top_k": 40,
    "output_dir": "../result/2wikimultihopqa_llama2_13b",
    "retriever": "BM25",
    "retrieve_topk": 3,
    "hallucination_threshold": 1.2,
    "fewshot": 6,
    "sample": 1000,
    "shuffle": false,
    "check_real_words": true,
    "es_index_name": "34051_wiki",
    "use_counter": true
}
```

The config files of the main experiments in the paper are all in the `config/`.

When you have prepared the configuration file, run the following command in the `src` directory:

```bash
python main.py -c path_to_config_file
```

### Evaluate

Upon completion of the program, you will find a folder named with a numerical identifier within your designated output directory. This identifier corresponds to the sequential order of runs within that folder, allowing for easy organization of multiple executions. Additionally, during the runtime, you will receive prompts indicating the specific folder where the current run's results will be saved.

Assume that the results of your run are saved in the `result/2wikimultihopqa_llama2_13b/1`ï¼Œrun the following command in the `src` directory to evaluate:

```bash
python evaluate_.py --dir path_to_folder(result/2wikimultihopqa_llama2_13b/1)
```

After the evaluation program has finished running, the results folder will contain the following files:

```plain
result/
â””â”€â”€ 2wikimultihopqa_llama2_13b/
    â””â”€â”€ 1/
        â”œâ”€â”€ config.json # the configuration file you use when running
        â”œâ”€â”€ details.txt # Evaluation details
        â”œâ”€â”€ output.txt # Original output file, which will contain statistical results if use_counter is set to true
        â””â”€â”€ result.tsv # Evaluation results
```

The elements in `output.txt` are as follows:

```json
{
    "qid": "question id", 
    "prediction": "origin outputs", 
    "retrieve_count": 0, 
    "generate_count": 1, 
    "hallucinated_count": 0, 
    "token_count": 64, 
    "sentence_count": 5
}
```

The elements in `details.txt` are as follows:

```json
{
    "qid": "question id", 
    "final_pred": "the output used for evaluation after extraction", 
    "EM": "EM result", 
    "F1": "F1 result"
}
```
